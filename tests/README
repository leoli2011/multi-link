We have two tools in this directory to testing the multi-link scheduling policy.

The one named modem_client.sh, which used to send huge of connections to outside
server through multiple modems. The default value of connection numbers is 1000.

The one named ml_count, which used to count the connection numbers for every modem.

Here are the steps:
1, running the modem_client.sh

mmu:/vendor/bin # sh client.sh
Connection to 47.92.141.202 50001 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
Connection to 47.92.141.202 50003 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
Connection to 47.92.141.202 50009 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
Connection to 47.92.141.202 50004 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
Connection to 47.92.141.202 50012 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
Connection to 47.92.141.202 50014 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
Connection to 47.92.141.202 50000 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
Connection to 47.92.141.202 50002 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
.........
.........
.........
Connection to 47.92.141.202 50992 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
Connection to 47.92.141.202 50993 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
Connection to 47.92.141.202 50991 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
Connection to 47.92.141.202 50994 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
Connection to 47.92.141.202 50995 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
Connection to 47.92.141.202 50996 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
Connection to 47.92.141.202 50997 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
Connection to 47.92.141.202 51000 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
Connection to 47.92.141.202 50999 port [tcp/*] succeeded!

2, Count the number of connections for each modem interface

mmu:/vendor/bin # ./ml_count
Modem1=348, Modem2=328, Modem3=321

3, Check the output of the step two, if the number of connections
for every interface have similar value means the feature works fine.
